                <h6>Scrolling options</h6>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                There are two ways to interact with Diary Viewer: asynchronous scrolling and synchronous scrolling. 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                <strong>Asynchronous scrolling</strong> involves moving your mouse over the left side of the webpage and scrolling downwards to advance our diary transcriptions and moving your mouse to the right side of the webpage and scrolling downwards to advance the original diary pages. In this scrolling mechanism, you are in control of what transcribed pages and what original diary pages you want to see at once (i.e transcribed page 12 and original diary page 31). 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                <strong>Synchronous scrolling</strong> means that both the transcribed text and original diary text are always the same page/text (i.e. transcribed page 12 and original diary page 12). 
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                You can switch between versions at the top of each diary viewer with a toggle button.
                </p>
            <h6> Page Finder </h6>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black"> If you want to view a specific page, you can enter that page number into the input box and press the Go button to advance to it. </p>
                <h6>Back to Top button</h6>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                A "Back to Top" button is located below the name of the diary that will take you back to the top of the page.
                </p>
                <h6>Catalog Page Link</h6>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                There is a quick link right beside the "help" button named "Catalog Page" that will take you to the catalog page with all the available diaries.
                </p>
                <h6>Margin Notes</h6>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                There are marginal notes in Arabic written in ink by the Baghdad historian Yaqub Serkis sometime after he received them from Alexander Svoboda probably in the late 1920s. Because these notes are a later addition extrinsic to Joseph Mathia Svoboda’s writings, we have gathered them in an appendix where they are listed under unique identifiers–for example [A47_006_09:001]–recording the diary number, place in the diary, and numerical order.
                </p>
                <h6>Page Link</h6>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;" color="black">
                The page numbers in the transcription are rendered as clickable links which will bring you to the corresponding image of the original diary page.
